In this project, we conducted an analysis of the data pertaining to 39,170 students enrolled in 15 different schools spanning grades 9 to 12. Our objective was to examine the relationship between students' grades in reading and mathematics and various characteristics of their schools, including budget, type, and size. We sought to determine the average performance of students in these subjects and investigate how school properties influence their educational outcomes.
